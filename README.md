The purpose of these functions is to convert microelectrode recordings from the Neuralynx format in to TRC files that are interpretable by Micromed Brain Quick.
It is required that EZ-Detect/HFO-Engine is already installed. ICA is implemented to reduce high-frequency noise in the LFP recording to optimize the detection
of high-frequency oscillations. Preliminary results using this approach were outstanding. Once the data are imported to TRC, HFOs can be detected using the new 
functions in HFO-Engine/EZ-Detect.
